# Skills

## Technical Writing Experience

I've been writing professionally since 2017. During this time, I have created demo tutorials, knowledge bases, how-to guides, quick starts, OpenAPI specification files, and API references from scratch.

I have worked in organisations that practice Agile, Kanban, and Scrum methodologies. I have extensive experience with the docs-as-code philosophy and love working on developer documentation. I thrive in roles where I can work with a mix of developer and documentation tools.
