# Flutterwave

I joined Flutterwave as a Developer Advocate in July 2019. I was tasked with improving relations with the developer community and creating relatable content via blog posts using web/mobile frameworks and Flutterwave's REST APIs.

## Technical Writing for Fintech Audiences

My work at Flutterwave was centered around creating technical content on Flutterwave's payment gateway. This involved creating written tutorials for users on how to build API based applications for card payments, bank transfer payments, refunds, chargebacks, and virtual wallets. I was also tasked with documenting part of the endpoints for Flutterwave's v3 API which was built using [ReadMe](https://readme.com/).

### Technical Account Management

During the pandemic, I double-hatted as a Technical Account Manager. My role here was to improve the way Flutterwave's tier one customers used our product. This was accomplished by analysing data on their payments and suggesting product improvements and adoption of new payment methods. I also improved my documentation skills during this period as I was responsible for creating knowledge bases for the technical account management team.

### Highlights

- I created multiple applications and accompanyng tutorials from scratch.
- I created knowledge bases designed to keep new members of the technical account management team up to speed and reduced friction during handovers within the team.
- I set up personalised user guides for our products for each Tier 1 business within the Technical Account Management portfolio
- I created a documentation framework for Pre-mortem and Post-mortem reports on various scenarios on service disruption. This indirectly helped to reduce customer drop-off by 8%.
