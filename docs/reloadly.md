# Reloadly

I joined Reloadly as a leading Developer Advocate in April 2021. There was no structure at the time for developer experience save for a few SDKs, a Postman collection, and an API reference hardcoded with HTML.

## Scaling Developer Relations

I was hired to create a developer relations framework for the company and I started with revamping the developer docs. After conducting a series of developer surveys, and considering the budget of my team, I went with a collaborative, open source workflow built with GitBook. I built this from scratch and got both the engineering and product teams contributing to the docs within my first six months at the company.

### Highlights

<br>

- I created product docs and API references for two products from scratch.
- I created a docs-as-code workflow with input and collaborations from team mates in engineering and product.
- I set up analytics to track developer searches and satisfaction index on the docs site. This was extrmemely helpful in adpating and modifying the docs to suite the feedback of developers.
- I set up and managed our internal CI/CD pipeline with BitBucket for the developer docs.

### Publicly Available Portfolio Pieces

- [Sample docs on GitBook](https://reloadlydocs.gitbook.io/airtime/): The company's docs which I created from scratch. We pivoted from this to an internal docs repo.

- [Sample docs - Webhooks](https://developers.reloadly.com/developer-tools/webhooks/overview): I rewrote this from legacy docs.
- [Sample docs - Airtime Service](https://developers.reloadly.com/airtime/introduction): I wrote this from scratch.
- [API reference repo](https://github.com/Reloadly/reloadly-api-docs): Reloadly's API reference (this is an external copy). I created this using [Redocly](https://redocly.com/).
- [Reloadly Developer Blog](https://www.reloadly.com/blog/category/developer-blog/): Blog Posts, tutorials, and how-to guides which were written to familiarise developers and end users about the product.

### Postman

I created a Postman Collection to help our customers with integrating our APIs more seamlessly. There was a gap in testing our APIs which I identified. First, I asked our support and solution teams if they had any pre-existing Postman collections for Reloadly. Once I got these, I revamped them, split requests into Live and Sandbox mode, organized them, and published them.

[See the collection here](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/17368362-7c653ee7-dcd3-4656-8788-7480e1e7c957?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D17368362-7c653ee7-dcd3-4656-8788-7480e1e7c957%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D39e26516-6fbf-4e24-9300-5d464325d6d6)

### Current Technical Writing Work

After launching the latest iteration of our developer documentation in September 2022, I focused on improving feedback collection from our documentation users and improving the quality of our documentation by regular updates and identifying documentation gaps. I also create technical tutorials on new features and use cases for our APIs.
