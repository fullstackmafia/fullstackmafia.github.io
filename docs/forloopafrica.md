# ForLoop Africa

I joined ForLoop Africa in 2017 as a volunteer Developer Advocate. My main duty was to organize community events such as meetups, conferences, workshops, webinars, and hackathons for beginners looking to begin a career in software development.

## Writing Tutorials on Web Development

Part of my outreach strategy was to partner with existing blogs such as Scotch.io (acquired by DigitalOcean in 2019), and LogRocket to create tutorials on web development.
