## Career Highlights

### Reloadly

- I developed Reloadly's strategy towards exposure to the global developer community. This put Reloadly within the map of approximately 1000 developers within the second quarter of 2021 and approximately 115 developers monthly thereafter.
- I wrote product docs and API references for Reloadly's major products from scratch. This enabled developers to easily adopt and accept our APIs into their projects.
- I set up analytics to track developer searches and satisfaction index on Reloadly's documentation. This was helpful in adpating and modifying the docs to suite the feedback of developers and retain them as repeat customers.
- I built and managed our internal CI/CD pipeline with BitBucket for the developer docs. This helped with streamlining our process and reducing our overall time-to-market when launching new product features.

### Flutterwave
- I reduced the time developers took to learn Flutterwave's APIs by building open source projects and writing tutorials about how to create them from scratch.
- I sped up the time developers took to adopt Flutterwave's APIs in their startups. This was done by organising a hackathon in collaboration with Andela, Microsoft, and GitHub.
- I increased transaction volume for a tier one customer by proposing and leading the integration of a new payment method which was more aligned to their use cases.
- I provided an alternative payment method on Flutterwave's modal by integrating a mobile payment platform to increase payment options for end users.
- I lessened the friction during handovers in the Technical Account Management team by creating knowledge bases that covered the team's standard operating procedures.

### ForLoop Africa
- I reduced the time students in the Nigerian ecosystem took to learning web development by organising multiple meetups, conferences, hackathons, and workshops with partners such as Andela and Flutterwave.
- I increased the amount of online learning resources students had for learning web development by writing over 30 tutorials on concepts and building applications with JavaScript.
- I reduced the time-to-market taken by six weeks for a 21-person Nigerian fintech startup by working on the first version of their API documentation.
