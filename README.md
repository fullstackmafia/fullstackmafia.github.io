# About

I'm Raphael. I have been working as a Web Developer Advocate since 2017. I love working with developer-focused docs and creating API references, quick starts, how-to guides, and tutorials for developers.

I also thrive in environments where I can collaborate with engineering, product, and customer success teams to ensure that a product's entire documentation suite is top-notch and evergreen. I love tinkering with API doctools and cleaning up outdated doc sets.

## My Ideal Work Environment

**Short version**: Have me own a product or process and trust me to get my work done. Communicate proactively with me (I'll always reach out first) and let me know when I'm doing awesome or need to improve. Give me room to advocate for end-user developers and solve their pain points.

**Long version**: I do my best work in organisations where I am trusted to get the job done in the most efficient way. I prefer a hands-off management style. My manager should not be someone who seeks to micromanage my tasks but a person who works on the broader roadmap with me, communicates feedback, and provides constructive criticism.

I appreciate an organisation where frequent, two-way communication is the norm. I like to have a healthy amount of ownership over my work and product area. I also don't mind taking on few tasks that are not related to my core job description but help the overall mission of the organisation.
